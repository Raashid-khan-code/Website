            <p class="p">The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment.
                The successor to the PlayStation 2, it is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It was first released on
                November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and
                Australasia.The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the
                seventh generation of video game consoles.

                The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to
                use Blu-ray Disc technology as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social
                gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console,
                through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. In September 2009, the Slim
                model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and
                thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up
                change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.

                During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte model, $499
                for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray
                capabilities and "untapped potential". The reception improved over time. The system had a slow start in the market
                but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model, and managed to sell 87.4 million units to
                outsell the competing Xbox 360 and become the eighth-bestselling video game console in history. Its successor, the
                PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013. On September 29, 2015, Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation
                3 were to be discontinued in New Zealand, but the system remained in production in other markets. Shipments of new
                units to Europe and Australia ended in March 2016, followed by North America which ended in October 2016.
                Heading into 2017, Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29, 2017, when Sony
                confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan.
